            <p>Born early Summer of 2005, Smudge was a personality from the start. She was adopted August of the same year and
                quickly adapted to her new home. Sable, a Rough-haired Collie, took to mothering her on the spot and raised
                her as her own. This upbringing took her already un-cat-like personality to the next level. Laid-back, as
                she is in the above photo, was Smudge's typical demeanor. From riding around in baby strollers to blessing
                you when you sneezed, Smudge was always sure to put a smile on your face. She loved all people and converted
                several self-defined "Cat Haters" into "Smudge Lovers". Sadly, after a battle with Cancer, Smudge passed
                away in her sleep August 2nd, 2018. </p>
